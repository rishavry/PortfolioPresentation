            Since I began my journey of applying for jobs on <b>February 15, 2025, at precisely 10:53 AM</b>, I have
            <b>received offers from 15 companies</b>, but have not yet accepted a single one. However, I have a
            comprehensive project, done all by myself, that more than makes up for the lack of formal
            employment experience — <b>Megagram</b>. This <b>12-month-long commitment</b> has been pivotal in <b>deepening my
            understanding of both foundational and advanced aspects</b> of full-stack web development, database management, and cloud
            service integration. Initially, I worked on <b>9 repositories within my Megagram GitHub organization</b>.
            But to avoid needless repetitive work in an unpaid project and to <b>do more with less</b>, I chose to concentrate
            on 3 key repositories that <b>more than suffice to demonstrate the depth of my abilities</b>:
            <b>Login-Register</b>, <b>Reset-Password</b>, and finally and above all, the grand <b>Home-Page</b>.
            <b>Unfortunately, none of the 3 repos are related to Amazon</b>(the enormous 'Online-Shopping' repository of
            my Megagram Organization was not concentrated on).

            For the <b>Instagram-inspired features</b> of Megagram, I employed a variety of tools to develop both the
